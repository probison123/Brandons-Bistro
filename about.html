            <h2><em>Brandon's Story</em></h2>
            <p class="story">
                Owner Brandon Johansen is a fourth generation restauranteur.  Brandon grew up in his parent's restaurant, working in the kitchen and busing tables.  After earning degrees in hospitality and finance, he established Brandon's Bistro in Ethereal in 1979.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                The restaurant began as a small diner on a corner of Main Street.  The diner had one small walk up window where people placed their orders to go.  Times have changed, today, Brandon's Bistro is offers cozy upscale inside dining as well as a take out menu, offering food second to none.
            </p>
            <h2><em>The Johansen Story</em></h2>
            <p class="story">It all began in 1900, when Brandon's great  grandparents immigrated to the United States and opened a small restaurant in Detroit.  Their restaurant catered to the other immigrants passing through the neighborhood.  Business was good and they expanded their business and Brandon's grandparents opened another location a few miles away.  In 1939, his grandparents moved North to Ethereal, where they opened a restaurant that became known far and wide for their chicken dinners.  Brandon's parents took over the restaurant years later.  Brandon grew up in this family restaurant and the rest is history...
